    expected_audience: "Developers who are familiar with workflow languages such as\

    expected_outcomes: This proposal is based on the idea of sharing workflows, so
      the outcomes may vary with the people we can work with. If we could have audiences
      who already have workflows that analyze the personal genomic data, we will describe
      them in CWL, and then test on our system running on DDBJ's HPC platform. We
      can help to package tools in containers for that as well, but it will be more
      productive if there were the BioConda/BioContainers team and/or the Elixir tool
      registry team. We already have CWL workflows that run on our system, so we can
      share our workflows and test if they are truly portable when there is a workflow
      execution platform team such as Galaxy. Our system can run workflows for non-human
      data as well, so we can import and test the workflows already described in CWL
      such as the MGnify workflow developed by the EBI Metagenome team or pgap pipeline
      developed by NCBI. We would be happy to present our system in details and help
      to deploy if there were people interested in having a similar system on their
      computing platform.

    expected_audience: REDCap experienced PHP software developers with clinical data

      FAIR data requirements.
    expected_outcomes: "General outcomes:\n -Potentially a paper called \u201CTen\
      \ lesson learnt making clinical research databases FAIR\u201D?\n -REDCap \u201C\
      FAIRify\u201D external module (built in PHP and Javscript) publicly available\
      \ on GitHub for installation (this will be reviewed by REDCap and if it passes\
      \ validation, will be added to the REDCap public repository of external modules)\n\
      \ -Project Configuration External Module to collect project meta data which\
      \ will be incorporated in the \u201CFAIRify\u201D META-META data\n \n Specific\
      \ output of the hackathon are:\n \n 1) An external module in REDCap that allows\
      \ clinical research database to include all the necessary machine code for machine\
      \ readable metadata of the REDCap metadata (contained in the Data Dictionary).\
      \ Perhaps a plugin that makes use of REDCap\u2019s Data Dictionary import facility\
      \ to import metadata to add to the data dictionary\n META-META data should include:\n\
      \ -Unique, persistent project identifier and variable ID\n -Location of dataset\
      \ \n -Type of dataset\n -Data Use Ontology Code (DUO Code)\n -Participant consent\
      \ codes (this should be derived from participant data consent component see\
      \ Item 4.)\n \n 2) Data definition code (derived from pre-defined ontology dictionaries\
      \ used by that project). Type of data source (with specific reference including\
      \ name and location if possible \u2013 data provenance, type of data source\
      \ would determine the requirements here e.g. direct patient report needs no\
      \ further information but imported data may need raw data file details, machine\
      \ details, data processing date etc.)\n \n 3) Version Control of the META-META\
      \ configurations\n \n 4) To provide a human readable configuration and output\
      \ of (1) in the REDCap database, with interactive configuration on the online\
      \ designer (linking to appropriate web-based ontology definitions of use)\n\
      \ \n 5) Possibly extend the capabilities of the ontology lookup fields in REDCap\
      \ by storing additional ontology information of data values on input (this may\
      \ not be necessary)\n \n 6) To include a patient consent component into REDCap\
      \ project. This means provide ontology consent coding to attach to project specific\
      \ consent requirements, including a participant interactive dashboard \u2013\
      \ this would be time dependent and possibly not achievable during hacakthon.\
      \ \n \n 7) To include a project configuration component for clinical research\
      \ project definition and meta data specifications (to be appended in Item 1\
      \ module)"
