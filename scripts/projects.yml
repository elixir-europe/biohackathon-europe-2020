- abstract: One of the recurring questions when it comes to BioHackathons is how to
    measure their impact. In order to do so, we first need to understand the outcomes
    from a BioHackathon. Some possible outcomes are software, publications and collaborations.
    Such outcomes could be analyzed from activity post-hackathon on GitHub repositories
    as well as publications generated out of BioHackathon topics. For the particular
    case of the BioHackathon-Europe, which has been running only for two years now,
    we propose to focus on GitHub activity post-BioHackathon. We want to learn about
    what happens with the ...

    The constant refactoring of ontologies, nomenclature and identifiers, as well
