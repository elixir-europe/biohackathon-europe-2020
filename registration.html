        <h1>Participant registration</h1>

        <p>Registration will be done in two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants nominated to work on selected projects (invitees) will be invited to register first (approx 60 participants)*
            <li>General registration will open in June (limited to 170 participants)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend that every participant stays at the event venue since it maximises networking and collaboration and ensures maximum productivity in this 4 day event. 
            (If you are unable to stay at the venue, please contact the organising committee biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org)</p>

        
        <h3>Co-funding from other projects</h3>
        <p>If you can apply for funding to cover the accommodation and travel from other sources,  and you require a specific booking confirmation or invoice, please let the organisers and the venue know as soon as possible no later than the <strong>4th November.</strong></p>

        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>The Biohackathon2020 will adhere to the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct">ELIXIR code of Conduct</a> and there will be ELIXIR Allies present at the event to ensure adoption of the Code of Conduct.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>* This means someone has nominated you in a project proposal as an essential contributor for facilitating the hacking during the event, and therefore your expenses will be partially or fully covered.</p>

        <p>Data protection: The registration form gives you the opportunity to share your contact details with other
        attendees. If you
        agree to share your details (name, email, affiliation), these will be kept by the ELIXIR Hub and on EvenBrite
        for
        two months after the event. After this time they will be deleted from both locations. If you want the details to
        be removed earlier, or if you have any queries, please contact us at bh2018paris@elixir-europe.org.</p>
