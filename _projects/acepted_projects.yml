- abstract: One of the recurring questions when it comes to BioHackathons is how to
    measure their impact. In order to do so, we first need to understand the outcomes
    from a BioHackathon. Some possible outcomes are software, publications and collaborations.
    Such outcomes could be analyzed from activity post-hackathon on GitHub repositories
    as well as publications generated out of BioHackathon topics. For the particular
    case of the BioHackathon-Europe, which has been running only for two years now,
    we propose to focus on GitHub activity post-BioHackathon. We want to learn about
    what happens with the ...

    The constant refactoring of ontologies, nomenclature and identifiers, as well
    as the discovery of new information, makes the life of knowledge curators difficult,
    especially in the highly diverse biology domain. For example, expert curators
    who use software tools to help them with the annotation process, might come across
    a new feature or functionality that does not exist within an ontology or data
    resource that their annotation tool connects to. Similar difficulties are faced
    by biologists who want to quickly curate ...

    software tools, as well as their virtualization, containerization and assembly
