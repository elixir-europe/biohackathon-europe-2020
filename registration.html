        <h1>Participant registration</h1>

        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/biohackathon-europe-2020-registration-104117179286" target="_blank" class="button fit special">Register here!</a>
        
        <p>Registration will be done in two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants nominated to work on selected projects (invitees) will be invited to register first (approx 60 participants)*
            <li>General registration will open in June (limited to 170 participants)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Going virtual</h2>
        <p>After much discussion internally at the Hub and with feedback from the programme committee, we have decided to run this year BioHackathon virtually instead of Face to Face.</p>
        <p>We realise this will be a disappointment for some of you, but after analysing the possible risk around local closures or travel bans due to the covid-19 pandemic, going virtual was the best option.</p>
        <p>We think this will allow everyone to participate in the BioHackathon and deliver tangible outcomes from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects.html">selected projects</a>.</p>
        <p>Please register ASAP (before 18th Sept),  as space will be limited and participation during all 4 days is expected</p>            
        
        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>The Biohackathon2020 will adhere to the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct">ELIXIR code of Conduct</a> and there will be ELIXIR Allies present at the event to ensure adoption of the Code of Conduct.</p>

        <p>* This means someone has nominated you in a project proposal as an essential contributor for facilitating the hacking during the event, and therefore your expenses will be partially or fully covered.</p>

        <p>Data protection: The registration form gives you the opportunity to share your contact details with other
        attendees. If you
        agree to share your details (name, email, affiliation), these will be kept by the ELIXIR Hub and on EvenBrite
        for
        two months after the event. After this time they will be deleted from both locations. If you want the details to
        be removed earlier, or if you have any queries, please contact us at bh2018paris@elixir-europe.org.</p>
