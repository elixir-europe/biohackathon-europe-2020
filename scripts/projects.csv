 email:","This biohackathon aligns with the following ELIXIR platforms: data, tools and interoperability. ELIXIR communities which may find it relevant are Human Data and Rare Diseases.","We expect to deliver a working prototype of a search and visualization interface that, given the search criteria and, if available, omics data, will scan the considered resources, combine the results into a molecular diagram, which then will become available for visualization in MINERVA and Hipathia platforms, linking the results to the sources in DisGeNET and other repositories. 
 
 A suggested workflow will look as follows:
 1. For a rare disease from Orphanet, retrieve the genes/variants from DisGeNET
 2. Interrogate disease maps via MINERVA to retrieve pathways in which these genes/variants are involved
 3. Identify omics data for the RD from omics data repository (e.g. transcriptomics)
 4. Feed output of 3 and 2 into Hipathia for modelling disease processes
 5. Use MINERVA for visualization of identified disease maps, and/or for integration of retrieved data
 
 If successful, we plan to continue this collaboration and aim for at least one bioinformatics paper. We will actively explore the possibility of establishing this search and visualization engine as part of ELIXIR services.","- Bioinformaticians with expertise in handling clinical data to define and consult use-cases for the RD mechanisms search
 - Bioinformaticians skilled in information retrieval, knowledge exchange and systems biology formats (SBML, SBGN, BioPAX) to design and implement the intra-tool pipelines
 - Bioinformaticians skilled in omics data retrieval and integration, to design and implement the data-level pipelines, including RD-connect
 - Web developers proficient with JavaScript to implement the search and visualization interface based on existing MINERVA plugin architecture
 
 Importantly, the organizers ensure participation of 1 web developer, and the following bioinformaticians: 2 for clinical data handling, 1 for knowledge retrieval and exchange and 2 for omics data handling. This way we secure the critical mass necessary for the biohackathon.","1. Steve Laurie, CNAG, expert in the RD research and member of the RD-connect resource, omics data integration

 *Migrate Galaksio to a more sustainable codebase.
 *Bring together key skills necessary to finalize some specific issues in the code.
 *Contribute to creation of a ""component library"" in Vue as components can be shared between Galaxy, Galaksio and other bioinformatics software using Vue.js (or where Vue.js can be easily added).","Galaxy administrators, developers and high level users.

 Computational Biology Division, University of Cape Town, South Africa",ELIXIR Data Platform,"General outcomes:
 -Potentially a paper called “Ten lesson learnt making clinical research databases FAIR”?
 -REDCap “FAIRify” external module (built in PHP and Javscript) publicly available on GitHub for installation (this will be reviewed by REDCap and if it passes validation, will be added to the REDCap public repository of external modules)
 -Project Configuration External Module to collect project meta data which will be incorporated in the “FAIRify” META-META data
 
 Specific output of the hackathon are:
 
 1) An external module in REDCap that allows clinical research database to include all the necessary machine code for machine readable metadata of the REDCap metadata (contained in the Data Dictionary). Perhaps a plugin that makes use of REDCap’s Data Dictionary import facility to import metadata to add to the data dictionary
 META-META data should include:
 -Unique, persistent project identifier and variable ID
 -Location of dataset 
 -Type of dataset
 -Data Use Ontology Code (DUO Code)
 -Participant consent codes (this should be derived from participant data consent component see Item 4.)
 
 2) Data definition code (derived from pre-defined ontology dictionaries used by that project). Type of data source (with specific reference including name and location if possible – data provenance, type of data source would determine the requirements here e.g. direct patient report needs no further information but imported data may need raw data file details, machine details, data processing date etc.)
 
 3) Version Control of the META-META configurations
 
 4) To provide a human readable configuration and output of (1) in the REDCap database, with interactive configuration on the online designer (linking to appropriate web-based ontology definitions of use)
 
 5) Possibly extend the capabilities of the ontology lookup fields in REDCap by storing additional ontology information of data values on input (this may not be necessary)
 
 6) To include a patient consent component into REDCap project. This means provide ontology consent coding to attach to project specific consent requirements, including a participant interactive dashboard – this would be time dependent and possibly not achievable during hacakthon. 
 
 7) To include a project configuration component for clinical research project definition and meta data specifications (to be appended in Item 1 module)",REDCap experienced PHP software developers with clinical data management experience or exposure to Ontologies database implementation and FAIR data requirements.,We will seek potential collaborators from the data platform and human/rare disease communities in ELIXIR,4,"May 02, 13:04",
